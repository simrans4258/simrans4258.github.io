            <h1 class="margin text-center">Javascript Project</h1>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>For context, this is the first project for the SEP11 course, and we basically had to use all our skills we learned in unit 1 of SEP11, which is Basic Javascript, in order to make an interactive website. We also had a bit of a reminder of HTML and CSS, in that case. We could either choose to work solo or with a partner, so me and my friend Lian chose to work with each other for the project.</p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>We had a couple of options on what to do to choose from when we had to do a form for the project. There was a pig latin translator, a bank simulator, and much more options. Me and Lian chose to do a weather clothes picker, as both of us were mutally interested in that. Basically, our website will use javascript elements such as <code>prompt()</code> and functions in order to see what the weather is like, and recommend them outfits. We put the outfits in an array, since that was mandatory for the project. Then, we used many conditional statements in order for the choices the user inputs to be a variety of options. We put all of that code into one function, and we were basically done from there. However, me and Lian wanted to do something more as we had some time, plus we can get extra credit, so we inputed a while loop to make the prompt loop until the user says no. After that, we were done with the project in no time and it was a success!</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>So of course, with making a website manipulated with javascript all by ourselves, it took some trial and error to get things to work. First of all, our code didn't even work at all when we started it. Why? Well, its because we ended up only putting the array into the function first, and the conditional outside of the function, so both elements didn't connect with each other and nothing worked. So, when we put everything into one function, our code finally ended up working. Another challenge we had was to get the while loop working, because we haven't actually learned how to use a while loop in class, we had to learn on our own. It was a bit confusing to see how a while loop works at first, but once we got the hang of it, it worked. </p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I have a couple of takeaways for this project. First, coding from scratch takes a lot of work, but that's good for you in the long run, so that you can have more familiarity with coding languages and learning how to make things on your own in the future, since that is what we'll most likely do in the future. Second, it's nice working with a partner, as while this can be a solo project, working together in a project helps with communication skills and how to collaborate on github, which is essential to this class. Finally, all I have to say is that working on this project was more fun than expected, and I'm glad that I completed it.</p>
