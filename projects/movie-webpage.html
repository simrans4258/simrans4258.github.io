            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2>Context</h2>
                <p>For our first project in SEP10, we were supposed to make our own movie webpage with all the HTML and CSS we learned so far in Mr. Mueller's class. We had to use replit for this project, and me and my partners, Leandro and Ali, all had to work together to do our parts.</p>
            <h2>Content</h2>
                <p>Because we were doing this project during Halloween season, we all decided to make our project based off that, named Trick No Treat. It's about a monster who terrorizes kids every Halloween, so a group of friends decided that they will take down the monster together one Halloween. We all made sure we did our parts well, as well as helping each other out along the way, especially since we were a group of three. Thanks to our knowledge of HTML and CSS, plus our teamwork, we managed to complete the project in time.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <h4>Challenges</h4>
                    <p>Honestly, the most challenging part about this project was planning how we should divide the work and how we should communicate with each other, considering we were a group of 3, which can make it easier to accomplish the task, but it's harder to keep track with 3 people at the same time. It was also challenging to make the story in general, as making stories and plots are pretty hard to do. Despite this, we managed to find ways to communicate with each other AND get a coherent story to work with in our project.</p>
                <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                    <p>I learned how to collaborate together as a team and make sure everyone does their role in this project. I also learned about how to use css elements more frequently in this project, like using span elements, and even learning animation in this project! Overall, it had been fun to work on this project with my partners, and I look forward to the projects we will have in the future, as it turns out, this isn't so bad after all!</p>
