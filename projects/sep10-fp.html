            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>For context, this project is basically about everything we learned so far in the year (HTML, CSS, Github, and Bootstrap) into a major project that we've been technically working on for the entire year, the Freedom Project. </p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>We basically made a website about a topic of our choosing, the technologies (and possible future technologies of it), and presented all we learned so far into the website itself, as we are almost making it off from scratch. We started from the beginning of school by researching our topics, and I chose art as a topic, because it's something I'm passionate about. We also had to learn a tool to add to our website as well, and I chose jQuery because I felt like that fit my website the most. When we actually made our website near the end of the year, I decided to add a navbar and some cards using Bootstrap to help me, and I used jQuery for the last part of the website. We also ended up recording our entire journey in our blogs, which helped us guide the way to success with this project. Overall, I really liked how the website turned out at the end, and I'm quite proud of my project.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h1>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Of course, while making this entire project, there are some challenges I had to face. One challenge I had to face was making part B for the website, which was making our own inventions of possible future inventions involving art. This was hard, as making stuff from your imagination, and making it believable is rough. However, I managed to get 3 ideas at the end which was good. Another challenge I had to face was making the project itself, as I used a template, but it didn't fit the format I wanted, so I had to make major adjustments in order for it to fit what I wanted, which took a long time to do. Luckily, the outcome was what I wanted at the end, which is good. The final challenge I ahd to face was to actually present my project twice to people, first was my class, then the judges at the SEP Expo. I was very nervous, as public speaking is something I really don't like, but thanks to the encouragement of my peers, I managed to get the presentations over with at the end.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Some takeaways I have from this project is that first, you should take your time to make something, especially if that something is quite important, like the Freedom Project in this case. It took a while for me to actually finish the website, but that is better than not finishing at all. Another takeaway I have is that it's okay to be nervous for something you are scared about, like presenting in my case, and that if you can face it, you can achieve many things and get it over with. The last takeaway I have is to make sure you enjoy yourself while making something, because it makes making things feel like a breeze, and that goes beyond the Freedom Project. Overall, I enjoyed making this project, and I look forward to what we have to do next year, as it is the start of new beginnings for us.</p>
