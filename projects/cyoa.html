            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>For context, this our second major project done in SEP10, which is why it is in this portfolio. This project is about Unit 2: Git and Github, and me and my partner, Matthew, had to work together to make an adventure game using our knowledge of markdown, cs50, and git and Github.</p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Me and Matthew were paired up due to the two of us wanting to do the same topic, a superhero adventure. We both decided to make a plan about this adventure, where the player is already a famous superhero, and what they should decide on where they go and who to save. We ended up making many choices on what the player should choose, which are on the plan image below. We ended up with a result of a nice superhero adventure, and both of us really liked how it turned out. You can play it with the link below.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Of course, when it comes to working on major projects like this, there are bumps along the way. First of all, we were working on it at the same time, so we had to constantly keep on git pulling and pushing so there wouldn't be that much coflicts with our markdown files. Luckly for us, we ended up working on different markdown files instead of the same one, so we didn't run into too much conflicts with that. Another challenge, however, is putting our plan onto our github page itself and naming our files. Since we were done with our project earlier, me and Matthew decided to finally put our plan, but it came out pretty weird when we turn on dark mode on Github. So, we decided to put an image on the background, and it ended up working as a result. I also realized we had a problem with the file name, as it had a space, so I adjusted it so it can work with links, as spaces conflicts with links.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I learned how to communicate and collaborate with my partner in a different way than what we did before. I also learned how to utilize cs50.dev and terminal, as it offers learning how to balance between remote and local files, and it helped me learn more about git and Github in general. Overall, I'm really glad on how this project turned out, and I'm looking forward to learning more about Github and knowing how to use it more in the future.</p>
