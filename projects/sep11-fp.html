            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Throughout the year, using the stuff we learned throughout the year, such as Javascript, some stuff we learned last year from web design, and the tools we learned this year. I ended up learning Earsketch as my tool, and I was in a partnership this year, so we had to work together to make this project happen.</p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Essentially, we had to make a game, simulation, or anything that is fun and easy to use for users. I ended up doing a partnership this year with my partner Nancy, and we decided to make a platformer game with music inputted in it. Nancy decided to use Phaser.js to make the platformer game, while I used Earsketch to make the music for the game. We also used stuff we learned last year to make the website for the game look nice, such as CSS to add background colors and nice fonts. Overall, we really liked how the game turned out at the end of it.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Of course while making the game, I had some challenges while doing so. First challenge I had to face was actually learning my tool Earsketch, as unlike other tools we had to learn, it's not really "connected" to editors and you have to edit the music completely on the Earsketch website, then you have to transfer it to another place were you can't even just make it only hearing, you have to download it. So, I ended up having to fix that issue by talking to my partner, and we got it resolved quite quickly as downloading the songs and sending them to her was actually plausable. Another challenge I had to face was making the songs itself, as I had to not only use what we learn from javascript into the game, but also make them around 30 seconds to a minute long, so it took a long time for me to make the songs sound good and to make them the appropriate amount of time. I made 5 in total, and I had to keep on editing and revising the code to make it cleaner and more efficient. A final challenge is presenting the project, as I was so nervous that I was going to do something wrong, but from encouragment from the others around me, I ended up finsihing it up and getting over with it in no time, so it wasn't bad after all.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Some takeaways I have from this project is that first, you should take your time to make something, especially if that something is quite important, like the Freedom Project in this case. It took a while for me to actually finish the project, but that is better than not finishing at all, especially since I was working with a partner this year. Touching upon that, another takeaway I have is that communication is very important, as due to our schedules separating us for the entire year, me and partner had to find different ways to communicate, such as texting or calling, and it really helped finish our project quicker and sooner. The last takeaway I have is to have a lot patience, as it really helped me get through the project, despite all the struggles I had with it along the journey. Overall, I enjoyed making this project, and I look forward to what we have to do next year, as it is the start of new beginnings for us.</p>
