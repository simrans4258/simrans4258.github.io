            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>For context, for the last project of SEP10 before the big Freedom Project, we had to work together with our table partners, who was Xue in my case, in order to utilize Bootstrap, which is what we learned in that unit, so we could make a website that fitted in certain requirements. </p>

            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>Unlike the previous projects we had done, the content was given to us prehand and we had to work with that. We basically had to make a website about a hot air balloon business with all the things Mr. Mueller provided for us. Me and my partner Xue decided to try our best to work together to make it look as pretty as possible while also following the requirements at the same time. Both of us ended up using pastel like colors and managed to add little things to it like pop ups and a slideshow. We also added the bonus for extra credit as we had time to do that. Overall, both of us ended up being rather proud of what we had done as a result, and all the hard work was worth it.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Of course, there were some challenges along the way of making this website. First, we had a lot of trouble while making one of the images responsive to mulitple different screens without it looking wonky, and it took mulitple different attempts for it to work correctly. There was also the fact that the slideshow was quite slow to get working, and both me and Xue had to make a lot of adjustments to the code in order for it to work. Oh, and we can't forget the merge conflicts, as a couple of those happened along the way making the website. But miraculously, we managed to fix all of those problems in time to do the extra credit icons and the eventual submission of our project. We were finally done with this and our unit.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>I have some takeaways about this project. First, teamwork is dreamwork, as me and Xue working together properly helped us make a lot of progress, and it was good to be partners. Second, you need a lot of patience, as the more you perservere while coding, the more your code will make sense and you are able to fix it. And finally, make sure to be careful while coding with more complicated code, as the littlest of mistakes can break your code. Overall, I'm happy that I got this project over with, and that I actually learned something from that experience.</p>
