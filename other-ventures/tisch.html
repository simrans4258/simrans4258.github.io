            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>I first found out about this program through scrolling through NYU programs to see if I'm interested in anything, and then I saw that the Tisch School of Arts and NYU is offering a Saturday program for 9-11 graders in many different fields, such as film making, art, theater, dance, and game design. I signed up for the latter, as not only did it count as a SEP opportunity, but I get to learn how to make games, which I was interested in. I ended up getting to the point where I had to do an interview, and I managed to get in the program, where me and other high school students from across the city had to work together to make games. There were three classes in total, and I was in the program from February to May, so here's a brief overview of them.</p>

            <h2>Game Design</h2>
            <p>The Game Design class is where we learn how to make tabletop games and the importance of testing out a game with people, as audience input on how a game works is just as important as the actual mechanics of the game working itself. We ended up playing a lot of tabletop games to get a sense of what we need to do. We ended up making two different projects, and we had different groups for each project, 4 in total since there was 16 of us. The first game we had to make was an abstract game, where we had nothing to work with but the materials and constraints given to us, and the second game was a themed game, where the theme had to match the mechanics of the game itself. It took a lot of work for us to complete the games, hence why we only really made one, and made concept slides for the other one, but it was a nice learning experience.</p>

            <h2>Game Literacy</h2>
            <p>The Game Literacy class is quite different from the other classes, since we play more games and see game from a literate perspective. We learned about the history of games, the different genres and types, the impact games had on humanity, and how to apply these concepts when making games in our other classes and game making in general. We played different types of games each Saturday, and we get to explore what type of impact these games have on us. In the end, we made some sort of game manifesto slides where we share our hot takes on games and present them to the class, and while there was no actual game making in the class, it was still fun.</p>

            <h2>Game Development</h2>
            <p>The Game Development class is the most similar to SEP, as it is the class where we learn how to code and program video games using a program named GameMaker. It was one of the hardest classes in my opinion as code is a lot to learn and while the class does go in depth, it feels like we also had to learn a lot on our own and get a lot of help. We ended up learning how to code out own little mini games using templates the teacher gave us, and then we had to work on our final project with our final groups, either in duos or trios, and we had to make it match the verb given to us, which is our constraint. While it took a long time to finish the games, I'm just glad it's done, and there's a link to the game me and my group made for the Dev class below.</p>

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Of course, I have some takeaways from partcipitating in this program for a while. First, is that teamwork is the dreamwork, as due to all the projects we had to do requiring teamwork, we all ended up getting together and working alongside with each other to make games together. While there were some difficulties here and there, whether it be sudden absenses or malfunctions within our game, if we all hadn't communicated with each other, even if its with different groups, we all wouldn't have finished our projects in time, and so I'm grateful for teamwork. Another takeaway I have is that while making games can be hard, the final product is indeed worth the price. While we really only made two games and had to make a lot of slideshows of game concepts at the end, it was still hard to do, as we were given little time, constraints, and other challenges we had to face during this program for our games. I came to realize that making games takes a lot of dedication and time, and I'm glad this program made me realize that, and despite the hardships, its the adventure of making games that is fun. The final takeaway I have is that playing games is actually important in the game making process, as a lot of the games we played in class and even on my own free time, ended up inspiring a lot of the games and game concepts we made, along with further understanding how games are important to people, and how good they are in general the more you realize. Overall, I really loved this program, and I'm glad that I managed to get in with other wonderful people.</p>
